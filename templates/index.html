                        Dummy Text! Artificial Intelligence enabled automated reception to perform as a human receptionist to avoid face-to-face interaction among mass people regarding their daily service in the current pandemic. Inspired by their current problem of mass congestion, our proposed AI-based Smart Reception can authenticate users and interact in Bangla language with humans by responding to university-domain-related queries, resulting in better business service and outcomes. We used OpenFace face recognition for authentication, having an accuracy of 92.92% with 1Ã—10-5 second training time for a new image by saving the image dataset as a collection of an array file. The Interaction Recognition system consists of three modules: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Interactive Agent, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis. We used the OpenSLR- Large Bengali ASR Training Data to train the Deep Speech 2 model for ASR with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 42.15%. We tested our developed database management architecture for the Interaction Recognition system with the three-step evaluation using BERT sentence transformer (paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2) that provided satisfactory responses with 92% accuracy, increasing the receptionist performance significantly. TTS module relays on WavNet gTTS model. Our research also demonstrated that a developed AI-based system could be an adaptive solution for any domain-specific reception system responsible for systematic and efficient customer service offline and online.
